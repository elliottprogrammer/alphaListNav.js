# Alphabetical List Navigation Filter - vanilla js

#### Similar functionality to [jQuery ListNav](https://github.com/esteinborn/jquery-listnav) but without the jQuery dependency. Made with vanilla JavaScript.

> **alphaListNav.js** will add a "letter-based" navigation bar to all of your lists. Click a letter to quickly filter the list to show items that match that letter.
