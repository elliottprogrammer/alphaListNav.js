# Alphabetical List Navigation Filter - alphaListNav.js 
### Filter An HTML List Alphebetically

> **alphaListNav.js** will add an alphebetical navigation bar to all of your lists. Click a letter to quickly filter the list to show items that match that letter. With many different options and features.

This plugin (**alphaListNav.js**) has very similar functionality to [jQuery ListNav](https://github.com/esteinborn/jquery-listnav) but has been re-written without the jQuery dependency. Made with vanilla JavaScript. It can serve as a drop-in replacement, removing the need for jQuery.
