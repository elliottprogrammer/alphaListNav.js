Credit to [Eric Stienborn](https://github.com/esteinborn) for the original [jQuery ListNav](https://github.com/esteinborn/jquery-listnav).  This plugin (**alphaListNav.js**) has very similar functionality to [jQuery ListNav](https://github.com/esteinborn/jquery-listnav) but has been re-written without the jQuery dependency. Made with vanilla JavaScript. It can serve as a drop-in replacement, removing the need for jQuery.
